*demo-ci-project* is a demo project built with the [Exekube framework](https://github.com/exekube/exekube) for deploying these applications using GKE:

- Concourse server (CI/CD service)
- ChartMuseum (Helm chart repository)
- Docker Registry v2

## Networking

### Privately expose your applications

By default, this project ships with minimally configured networking for simplicity and ease of setup, though our services will be available only privately via `kubectl proxy` (from within the cluster). For this project, you can enable the proxy by typing in your shell

```sh
docker-compose up
```

Use can then access the applications using the "Private address" links below.

### Publicly expose your applications

If we want to expose our services (applications) on the public Internet, we will need to:

1. Create an [external static IP address](/) for `nginx-ingress` (Kubernetes LoadBalancer type of service)
2. Enable `nginx-ingress` Helm release
3. Create DNS records to point clients to this address
4. Enable [cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager) Helm release and create issuers + certificate for issuing SSL/TLS certificates for our domains
5. Enable `Ingress` resources for our Helm releases

Use [this pull request](/) as an example of how to set up production networking.

There is also a step-by-step tutorial: <https://docs.exekube.com/in-practice/production-networking>


## Modules

### Base modules

This project uses the Exekube [base-project](https://github.com/exekube/base-project) as boilerplate.

Modules from base-project:

- gke-network
- gke-cluster
- administration-tasks

### modules/nginx-ingress

We use nginx-ingress as our ingress controller for the applications.

### modules/cert-manager

We use cert-manager to acquire Let's Encrypt TLS certificates to enable HTTPS for publicly available appications.

### modules/concourse

Guestbook is a canonical example of a Kubernetes deployment
